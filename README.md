## Web Server Project

## Project Description:
This project focuses on introducing network programming and the socket API by building a simple ECHO server. The server accepts inconing TCP connection requests and echoes back any received string. The project is implemented in C/C++ and is designed to run on a Linux server environment.

## Features
- Accepts incoming TCP connections on a user-defined port.
- Optional verbose mode (`-v`) for printing diagnostic messages during operations.
- Supports CLOSE and QUIT commands for connection management.
- Complies to a binary name `echo_s` with no errors or warnings.
- Must compile and run on `Isengard.mines.edu`

## Running the project
```bash
make
```
```
./echo_s -v
```
